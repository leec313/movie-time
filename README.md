# **Objective**

# **User Experience (UX)**

  ## **Wireframes**

  The design & wireframes for this project were produced in [Balsamic Wireframe Software](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). This includes design prototypes for both, smaller and larger screens. The final design does differ from the initial prototype due to design developments that occurred in the process. However, the base structure has more or less been kept in mind throughout.

## To Deploy the Project

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

  The live link can be found here - https://leec313.github.io/movie-time/

## Local Deployment

- I also deployed the site locally by downloading the .zip file from Github to my device.
- I unzipped the file and tested each link page to make sure it opened correctly on my browser.

## To Fork the Repository 

- A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. This copy can be viewed and changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository. Take the following steps to fork the repository;

  1. Log in to **GitHub** and locate the [repository](https://github.com/leec313/movie-time).
  2. On the right-hand side of the page inline with the repository name is a button called **'Fork'**, click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.
