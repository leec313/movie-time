# Movie Time

Movie Time is an interactive quiz game centered around movies, featuring three distinct categories, each comprising ten questions. Every question presents the user with four options to select from. A correct answer awards the player one point, while an incorrect response increments the incorrect score counter by one. After finishing a category, players have the option to replay the same category or opt for a different one.

# **Objective**

# **User Experience (UX)**

  ## **Wireframes**

  The design & wireframes for this project were produced in [Balsamic Wireframe Software](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). This includes design prototypes for both, smaller and larger screens. The final design does differ from the initial prototype due to design developments that occurred in the process. However, the base structure has more or less been kept in mind throughout.

## To Fork the Repository 

- A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. This copy can be viewed and changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository. Take the following steps to fork the repository;

  1. Log in to **GitHub** and locate the [repository](https://github.com/leec313/movie-time).
  2. On the right-hand side of the page inline with the repository name is a button called **'Fork'**, click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

  # **Acknowledgments**

  This project represents the culmination of my efforts during the Full Stack Software Development (E-commerce Applications) course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/). Serving as my Portfolio Project 2, it allowed me to delve into the vast world of JavaScript and acquire invaluable knowledge along the way. Throughout this journey, I have acquired a plethora of new skills, making me immensely proud of the final outcome. The process has been incredibly enlightening, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of various concepts and techniques. I would like to extend my appreciation to my Mentor, Rory Patrick, and my Cohort, Alan Bushell, as well as the entire Code Institute community who have been instrumental in providing me with invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey. Their collective wisdom and assistance have been so important in helping me navigate through the challenges and complexities of this project. I am deeply grateful for the sense of camaraderie and collaboration within the Code Institute community, as it has fostered an environment where I could seek help and guidance whenever needed. I am truly fortunate to have had such a supportive network of individuals who have contributed to my growth and learning as a Full Stack Software Developer.
